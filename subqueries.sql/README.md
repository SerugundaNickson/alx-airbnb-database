## Practice Subqueries

### Objective:
To demonstrate the use of subqueries, including both correlated and non-correlated ones, for data analysis.

### Tasks:
1. **Non-Correlated Subquery:**
   - Find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0.
   - The query calculates the average rating per property using a subquery and filters those with average > 4.0.

2. **Correlated Subquery:**
   - Find users who have made more than 3 bookings.
   - The subquery counts bookings for each user and filters only those with a count greater than 3.

### Files:
- `subqueries.sql`: Contains both SQL queries for the subquery tasks.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the task, objectives, and approach.

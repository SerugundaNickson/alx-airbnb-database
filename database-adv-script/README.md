# SQL Join Queries – ALX Airbnb Advanced Database Project

This project is part of the "Unleashing Advanced Querying Power" module for the ALX Airbnb Database. The objective is to master SQL JOIN operations through practical queries.

## Files

- **joins_queries.sql** – Contains all SQL JOIN queries for this task.
- **README.md** – Describes the purpose and structure of the task.

## Task Objective

Write SQL queries that demonstrate the use of:

1. `INNER JOIN`: To retrieve all bookings and the users who made them.
2. `LEFT JOIN`: To list all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.
3. `FULL OUTER JOIN`: To list all users and bookings, even if they are not linked.

> Note: Some SQL engines like MySQL do not support FULL OUTER JOIN. A `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` can be used as an alternative.
